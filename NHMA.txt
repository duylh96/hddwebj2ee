Farewell words too often part
And cleave with sorrow to aching hearts.
With a final wave, all disappears
Beneath the hush of silent tears

Why can't sorrow be so kind
As to hide away and stay confined?
And leave us only thoughts of bliss,
Of joyful things to reminisce.

So focus not on sorrows, born
Where happy times are now forlorn,
But instead on joy and merriment
And delight all felt without relent.

And with all the love to fill our hearts,
Sorrow and pain then soon departs.
And although goodbyes are bittersweet.
We can no longer feel incomplete.

“Goodbye may seem forever. Farewell is like the end, but in my heart is the memory and there you will always be.”
That's what someone would said, but with a real friend, it’s only "see you later." :)
